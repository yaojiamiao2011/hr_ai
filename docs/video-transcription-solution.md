# Video Transcription Issue Analysis and Solution

## Problem Summary
The video transcription functionality in the HR AI project is returning empty results ("转录结果为空") when processing video files. The API endpoint is working correctly, but the underlying Whisper transcription process is failing.

## Root Cause Analysis
After thorough investigation, we've identified that the issue is caused by the Whisper executable not being found or accessible. The AudioTranscriptionService attempts multiple approaches to run Whisper:

1. First, it tries to use Java bindings (WLLM library) which are not available
2. Then it tries to use the whisper.cpp command-line interface
3. Finally, it falls back to using the whisper command from PATH

The problem is that none of these approaches are working properly.

## Current State Verification
- ✅ Video file exists: `hr_ai_project/src/main/resources/vide/ef6730ac-c64d-406a-bcda-ea3d015781af.mp4`
- ✅ Model file exists: `hr_ai_project/src/main/resources/Models/ggml-base.bin`
- ✅ Audio extraction using JavaCV/FFmpeg appears to be working (no errors reported)
- ❌ Whisper executable is not found in any of the expected locations
- ❌ No transcription output file is generated

## Solution Recommendation

### Option 1: Install Whisper.cpp (Recommended)
1. Download or compile whisper.cpp from https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp
2. Place the executable in one of these locations:
   - Project root directory as `whisper.exe` or `main.exe`
   - `hr_ai_project/bin/` directory as `whisper.exe`
   - Any location and update the PATH environment variable

### Option 2: Use Python-based Whisper
If installing whisper.cpp is not feasible, consider using the Python version:
1. Install Python and pip
2. Install whisper: `pip install openai-whisper`
3. Modify the AudioTranscriptionService to call the Python version instead

### Option 3: Update AudioTranscriptionService
Modify the service to provide more detailed error information by:
1. Adding more comprehensive logging around each step
2. Checking for specific error conditions and reporting them clearly
3. Adding a configuration option for the Whisper executable path

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Try installing whisper.cpp and placing the executable in the project directory
2. Test the transcription functionality again
3. If that doesn't work, add more detailed error logging to identify exactly where the process is failing
